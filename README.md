<!-- Problem statement -->
## Problem
In recent times, most of the universities and colleges were forced to operate behind closed doors due to corona virus outbreak.
The online mode of education was challenging to adapt for both students as well as faculties. Prior to development of this application, faculties had to upload lecture recordings on google drive and share the drive link with students on a daily basis.
On part of the students, they had to download the videos to watch lectures. It was difficult to maintain proper sequence and flow of lectures and also uploading and downloading everyday was a cubersome task and required a lot of time to be invested.

Hence, CharuVidya provided a platform for faculties and students for easy access to the lecture materials.

* User friendly UI with easy navigations.
* Courses are divided into categories and sub-categories.
* An embedded video player to watch lectures in the browser itself.
* Allows faculties to attach quizzes and lecture materials for each video lecture.
* Each course goes through a thorough review process before it is available on the portal.
* Admin allocates a reviewer to each course and only after approval from the reviewer, course is available for students.
